# NodeJs API Backend

This project was generated with NodeJs, Express, JWT, and Mongoose. I made this API for use as MEAN stack. You could use this for a front-end of your choice.

## Pre-requisites

Rename the `nodemon.json.example` file to `nodemon.json`. This is the file to store your Database and JWT Key credentials for security. You could also create your own `env` file to store your passwords for the database and jwt key. Make sure to add that to `.gitignore` if you plan to upload to Github. For use of `.env` you will need to use `dotenv` and you can find more on their main page for usage. 

I used MongoDB for my database. You can use your choice of database and change the `app.js` to fit your needs.

## Development server

Run `npm run start:server` for a dev server using Nodemon. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Build according to your server that you will use.
